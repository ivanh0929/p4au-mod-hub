# What is this?

A place for me to upload and keep track of my P4AU mods and palettes in case I need to download them again for whatever reason.

# How can I use this?

Either download a folder that's setup for Reloaded-II already (they usually have a folder that says Redirector with a folder within that which says asset) or download the palette files and apply them yourself with PalMod.
