# My P4AU Mod Hub!



## What is this?

A place for me to upload and keep track of my P4AU mods and palettes in case I need to download them again for whatever reason.

## How can I use this?

Either download a folder that's set up for Reloaded-II already (they usually have a folder that says Redirector with a folder within that which says asset) or download the palette files and apply them yourself with PalMod.

## Anything else planned for the future?

- Make Releases for all of my mods that can be easily downloaded for Reloaded-II
